        - talk about that there is each extended and strict version
          and it is possible to transform source code loop -> goto <-> while <- loop
          (every loop program is total, goto/while not necessarily). The
          transformation from one language to another is from GTI. Most of
          the transformations from extended to strict is from me and not optimized
          at all. Give example from loope program that is transformed to gotos
          program (x0 := x1 / x2) :).
          Some of the exercises are from GTI.
    - Language Specifications from GTI Skript
        - You can only implement functions from N -> N
                - Loop
                    - syntax (grammar)
                    - semantics
                    - extended
                - While
                    - syntax (grammar)
                    - semantics
                    - extended (while head can have bexp, rest like loope)
                - Goto
                    - syntax (grammar)
                    - semantics
                    - extended (optional labels, can be named like identifiers,
                      HALT can come inside if body, rest like loope)
    - Exercises
        - give one example solution
    - Code Design (how the code is designed)
                - if there was easy way to spit javascript from haskell rather
                  that instead of server based program
                - only one evaluation language...
                - ...
                - I guess much can be improved, if you have suggestion come at me, brah
        - Tests
            - Put the note from tests here (transformation strict...)
                
                -- Note: Some of the tests don't use a hand-written strict program to test the
                -- transformations against but instead they test against a simplified extended
                -- program that is automatically transformed to a strict program (e.g. most of
                -- the control tests). The reason for this decision is that a strict program
                -- would simply be too long and too convoluted to comprehend the applied
                -- transformations. Nonetheless these tests are not useless as the more
                -- primitive tests "ensure" that the transformations of the simplified extended
                -- version to a strict version will be correct.

    - Future -> to Readme
        - Optimizations
            - remove redundancy (e.g. remove "x0 := x0 + 0")
            - other optimizations?
        - Function Definitions
        - Include Statement
        - Code Improvements
            - remove code duplication

- put on github
- ask Vollmer (ok with it, credit, using exercises/text from skript, is it
  correct that bloop floop inspired?...)


How to improve the code?
========================

    - how to remove code duplication? Especially toStrict transformations.
        - how to better extract common functionality?
            - expression problem? open datatypes?
    - should this be put on hackage?
    - Is there a reason in favor of Parsec3 instead of 2?
    - Make languages instances of Foldable for e.g. easier renaming of vars?
    - think about type class to get and change var names?
    - What advanced type features / language extensions / libraries could improve the code?
      Mainly remove code duplication by using abstractions?
    - Improve evaluator so that instead of creating a lazy infinite list of STRefs
      just initialize STRef with 0 when it is first used, so that it doesn't take
      so much time to create the list from 0 till n, where n is a big number
      (e.g. x999999999999999 takes too long) (Maybe Map)
    - unify naming convetions (e.g. if qualifed import AS than GotoAS not Goto)
    - improve output of pretty printers
        - e.g. dismiss superfluous parentheses

Try in your browser
===================

- create projects loopgotowhile-server, loopgotowhile-site

- Think about trying in browser and how to prevent overloading of server

What's next?
============

- Function definition for extended with "lexical" scope + nested functions
    - look at the parsec examples to get some ideas but basically just a constructor Func FIdent Stat
    - rather macros than real functions that are like nested programs
      where parameters are x1,... and output is x0
    - spricht etwas gegen verschachtelte funktionsdefinitionen? -> no
    - need not only keep vars as state but also function definitions
      and function definitions can be arbitrarily nested so keep tree of
      function definitions
- Think about import ("include" fits better) statement
    - implicitly include "prelude"
    - if functions are supported use function definitions instead of manually
      translating * + etc. e.g. just rewrite x1 * x2 to mul(x1,x2) and mul
      is implicitly included from the prelude
- reduce tests size
    - either delete or add everywhere type Assertion
    - reuse strict tests for extended versions
    - reuse extended arithmetic tests that do not use loop constructs
    - reuse/create transformation tests from xE to yE that do not use looping
      constructs (should become the same)
    - reduce transformation to strict tests for goto and while to only specific
      things if it has been possible to factor out common strict transform. code
