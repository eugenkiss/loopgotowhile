- create while language with code duplication and copy all tests
- how to remove boilerplate duplication?
    - how to better use Core and CoreE for defining common functions/data
        - expression problem? open datatypes?
- Transformations
    - x_extended -> x_strict
    - LOOP -> WHILE
    - WHILE <-> GOTO
    - LOOP -> WHILE -> GOTO
- Use strict while as evaluation language and just translate every program
  to strict while and evaluate with strict while

- Function definition for extended with lexical scope + nested functions
    - rather macros than real functions that are like nested programs
      where parameters are x1,... and output is x0
    - spricht etwas gegen verschachtelte funktionsdefinitionen?
    - need not only keep vars as state but also function definitions
      and function definitions can be arbitrarily nested so keep tree of
      function definitions around
- Think about import ("include" fits better) statement
    - implicitly include "prelude"
    - if functions are supported use function definitions instead of manually
      translating * + etc. e.g. just rewrite x1 * x2 to mul(x1,x2) and mul
      is implicitly included from the prelude
- Pretty printer for each parser 

- Create cltools
- Update to Parsec 3
- Remove the warnings (by improving the code)
- Go through Todos
- run HLint
- Create try in your browser website
- create readme (language definition, examples etc.)
    - provide grammar
    - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlooP_and_FlooP

- Future -> to Readme
    - Optimizations
        - remove redundancy (e.g. remove "x0 := x0 + 0")
    - LLVM Output? -> http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/llvm
    - Create Javascript version (to directly run in browser)?
        - Translation tool from hs -> js?

- How to improve code?
    - ask questions from todos
    - Provided Parsec examples
    - Other examples from internet
    - Other parser libs?
        - http://projects.haskell.org/grammar-combinators/
        - Alex, Happy
    - What advanced type features / language extensions would improve the code?
      Mainly remove code duplication by using abstractions?
        - View Patterns?
        - Type Families?

- create documentation
    - code design/rationale
        - Data Types in own file because of mutual recurions import
        - Tests of whiel and goto are smaller because if transforms to loop
          correct, no need to test
        - abstract has common features
        - each language has strict and extended version
        - ...
    - syntax
        - grammer
    - semantics
    - examples
    - exercises
    - try in your browser

- Think about trying in browser and how to prevent overloading of server
