How to improve the code?
========================

- Should this be put on hackage?
- Is there a reason in favor of Parsec3 instead of 2?
- Make languages instances of Foldable for e.g. easier renaming of vars?
- Think about type class to get and change var names?
- What advanced type features / language extensions / libraries could improve the code?
  Mainly remove code duplication by using abstractions?
- Improve evaluator so that instead of creating a lazy infinite list of STRefs
  just initialize STRef with 0 when it is first used, so that it doesn't take
  so much time to create the list from 0 till n, where n is a big number
  (e.g. x999999999999999 takes too long) (Maybe Map)
- unify naming convetions (e.g. if qualifed import AS than GotoAS not Goto)

What's next?
============

- Function definition for extended with "lexical" scope + nested functions
    - look at the parsec examples to get some ideas but basically just a constructor Func FIdent Stat
    - rather macros than real functions that are like nested programs
      where parameters are x1,... and output is x0
    - spricht etwas gegen verschachtelte funktionsdefinitionen? -> no
    - need not only keep vars as state but also function definitions
      and function definitions can be arbitrarily nested so keep tree of
      function definitions
- reduce tests size
    - either delete or add everywhere type Assertion
    - reuse strict tests for extended versions
    - reuse extended arithmetic tests that do not use loop constructs
    - reuse/create transformation tests from xE to yE that do not use looping
      constructs (should become the same)
    - reduce transformation to strict tests for goto and while to only specific
      things if it has been possible to factor out common strict transform. code
